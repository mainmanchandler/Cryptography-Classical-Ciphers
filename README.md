# Cryptography Classical Ciphers
Classical ciphers implemented with Python from Scratch, including encryption/decryption methods. Some also include a cryptanalysis method to decrypt encrypted text with little or no key information. Built alongside basic utility, matrix, and modular artihmetic classes. Implemented for my Applied Cryptography class. All Testing, ciphertexts, and plaintext are not mine and were provided to us by the professor for testing.
